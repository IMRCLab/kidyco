# Introduction

This is a summary of important kinodynamic systems of varying complexity to simplify research and benchmarking in the area of motion planning and controls, for single- and multi-robot systems.

Particular emphasis is on including results such as differential flatness, interesting instances (with respect to bounds), and relationship to real robots.
